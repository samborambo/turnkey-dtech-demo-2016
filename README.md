# Simplied DTech 2016 Repository #
Welcome to the OpenFMB Repo for the simplified demonstration from 2016 DistribuTECH Conference

In the original demonstration on the distributech floor, multiple vendors were communicating over wireless to simulate a small microgrid system.

The repository is for the code based for the simplified demo.   This site contains a [WIKI](https://github.com/openfmb/dtech-demo-2016/wiki) for deploying the demo. 

All code leverages various open source licenses.  Each code module has it own license file.
