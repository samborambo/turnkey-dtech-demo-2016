# Simplified DTech 2016 Repository 
Welcome to the OpenFMB Repo for the simplified demonstration from 2016 DistribuTECH Conference

In the original demonstration on the Distributech floor, multiple vendors were communicating over wireless to simulate a small microgrid system with actually resource controllers.  

This repository is for the code base of the simplified demo.   This site contains a [WIKI](https://github.com/openfmb/dtech-demo-2016/wiki) for deploying the demo. 

All code leverages various open source licenses, please refer to the specific module for its LICENSE.txt file.
