# 2016 DistribuTECH - Simplified OpenFMB Demonstration 
Welcome to the OpenFMB Repo for a simplified microgrid demonstration from the 2016 DistribuTECH Conference.

In the original demonstration on the Distributech floor, multiple vendors were connected over wireless communications to simulate a small microgrid system with actual resources.  

This repository contains the wiki and supporting resource files for the simplified demo. This demonstration contains OpenFMB CIM data structures and is based on the MQTT publish and subscribe application layer protocol.  This site contains a [WIKI](https://github.com/openfmb/dtech-demo-2016/wiki) for deploying the demo system. 

For futher information requests or for reporting issues please submit an [New Issue](https://github.com/openfmb/dtech-demo-2016/issues/new)
